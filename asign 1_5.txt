1.Explain hadoop in layman's term

	*Hadoop is a set of open source programs and procedures.

	*Hadoop is Java-based programming framework that supports the processing 
	 and storage of very large data in a distributed environment

	*With help of Hadoop we can run applications on systems with thousands of commodity 
	 hardware nodes


2.2.Explain the components of Hadoop framework

	*Hadoop Distributed File-System - allows data to be stored in an easily accessible 
	 format over a large number of linked storage devices,

	*MapReduce - reading data from the database, putting it into a format suitable for 
	 analysis and performing operations over the data.
	
	*yarn - it manages resources of the systems storing the data and running the analysis.

3.Explain the reasons to learn Big data technologies

	*Performance - The performance of the entire process is high as it is in distributed
	 environment which is handled through parallel processing.

	*Ability to handle huge data - Any volume of data can be stored in HDFS and can be 
	accesed very easily.

	*Cost Efficiency - Hadoop reduces the cost and performance by using the commodity systems .
